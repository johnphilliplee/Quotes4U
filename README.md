# Quotes4U

This is a demo application. It fetches Kanye West quotes and puts them in the UI. The user can swipe left to discard the quotes or swipe right to save to local storage.

Uses Combine, SwiftUI and Core Data.

## Development setup
- We use [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules), they can be initialised and kept up to date with:
  - `git submodule update --init --recursive`
